      "article": "The Texas Senate has acquitted state Attorney General Ken Paxton of all impeachment articles filed against him for corruption and unfitness for office. \n\nThough there is bipartisan support for impeachment, votes to convict on each charge did not clear the 21-vote threshold. Republican Sens. Robert Nichols and Kelly Hancock joined all 12 Democrats to vote in favor of conviction on several charges. \n\nThe Texas Senate convened at 10:30 a.m. central time Saturday to vote and finished just before 1 p.m. \n\n\"Today, the truth prevailed. The truth could not be buried by mudslinging politicians or their powerful benefactors,\" Paxton said in a statement thanking his supporters after the verdict was delivered. \n\n\"The sham impeachment coordinated by the Biden Administration with liberal House Speaker Dade Phelan and his kangaroo court has cost taxpayers millions of dollars, disrupted the work of the Office of Attorney General and left a dark and permanent stain on the Texas House,\" Paxton said, calling the \"weaponization\" of impeachment \"immoral and corrupt.\" \n\n\"Now that this shameful process is over, my work to defend our constitutional rights will resume. Thank you to everyone who has stood with us during this time,\" he added. \n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated Paxton after the trial concluded. \n\n\"The jury has spoken. Attorney General Ken Paxton received a fair trial as required by the Texas Constitution. I look forward to continuing to work with the Attorney General to secure the border and protect Texas from federal overreach,\" Abbott said. \n\nThe jury of 30 senators, most of whom are Republicans, spent about eight hours deliberating behind closed doors since the Senate ended deliberations. A two-thirds majority was required to convict Paxton on any of 16 articles of impeachment that accuse Paxton of bribery, corruption and unfitness for office.\n\nThe vote was a slow, public process. Each article of impeachment received a separate vote. Republicans hold a 19-12 majority in the Senate, meaning that if all Democrats voted to convict Paxton, they needed nine Republicans to join them. At most, they got two. \n\nPaxton faced accusations that he misused his political power to help the real estate developer Nate Paul. Paxton's opponents have argued that the attorney general accepted a bribe by hiring Paul.\n\n\"If we don’t keep public officials from abusing the powers of their office, then frankly no one can,\" Republican state Rep. Andrew Murr, one of the impeachment managers in the Texas House, said during closing arguments. \n\nAttorneys for the bipartisan group of lawmakers prosecuting Paxton’s impeachment rested their case Wednesday after a woman who was expected to testify about an extramarital affair with Paxton made a sudden appearance at the trial, but she never took the stand.\n\nThe affair was central to the proceedings and accusations of Paul, who was under FBI investigation and employed the woman, Laura Olson. One of the articles of impeachment against Paxton alleged that Paul's hiring of Olson amounted to a bribe.\n\nPaxton's lawyers have cast the impeachment effort as a ploy by establishment Republicans to remove a proven conservative from office, pointing to Paxton's long record of challenging Democratic presidential administrations in high profile court cases that have won him acclaim from former President Donald Trump and conservative hardliners. \n\n\"I would suggest to you this is a political witch hunt,\" Paxton attorney Tony Buzbee said. \"I would suggest to you that this trial has displayed, for the country to see, a partisan fight within the Republican Party.\"\n\nPaxton was also previously indicted in June for allegedly making false statements to banks. \n\nPaxton, who was suspended from office pending the trial's outcome, was not required to attend the proceedings and appeared only once in the Senate, durinc closing arguments, since testimony began last week. His wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, sat across the room from him. She was required to be present for the whole trial but was prohibited from participating in debate or voting on the outcome of her husband's trial. \n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and the Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n\n\n(This was copied and Pasted from the Fox News Website)\n",

      "article": "Now that the US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have signed off, you won’t have to wait long to get your updated Covid-19 shot. Major pharmacy chains have already started rolling out vaccine appointments.\n\nManufacturers say the tweaked mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are effective against EG.5, the strain that is currently dominant in the United States, as well as other emerging variants.\n\nHealth officials are urging people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are continuing to creep up and the threat of other respiratory viruses, including flu and RSV, loom ahead this fall. For the first time, vaccines are available against all three.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about when and where you should get the vaccines you need to stay healthy this fall.\n\nWho should get vaccinated\nEveryone age 6 months and older should get an updated Covid-19 vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of experts that advises the agency on vaccines, said on Tuesday that everyone ages 5 and older should get at least one dose of an updated mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 this year.\n\nCDC recommends updated Covid-19 vaccines for everyone 6 months and older\nChildren age 6 months through 4 years who are getting their vaccines for the first time should get two doses of a Moderna vaccine and three doses of a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and at least one of the doses should be the updated vaccine.\n\nThe committee also recommended that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get at least three doses of Covid-19 vaccine, with at least one of those doses being an updated shot. They also have the option to get an additional updated vaccine later in the year.\n\nThe committee has not decided whether people 65 and older will need another dose of the updated vaccine in a few months. Most older adults became eligible for a second dose of a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine this past spring.\n\n“The committee is very committed to equity, to make sure that everyone in our very diverse country will have access to the vaccine,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and former medical director of the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\n﻿That means recommending more doses for people who are at higher risk of severe illness, such as people ages 65 and older, people who have weakened immune systems or underlying conditions and people who live in nursing homes or pregnant.\n\nFDA signs off on updated Covid-19 vaccines that target circulating variants\nIt is these people who will benefit the most from the new vaccines, according to Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in developing either the of the new shots but previously helped study the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\n“The primary goal of these vaccines is to reduce the risk of severe disease, which is a very important goal, but it is not likely that these boosters will provide frank protection against the acquisition of infection and probably only modest effect on mild disease,” he said. “And so, these boosters will likely be important for people who are at severe risk of disease.”\n\nFlu and RSV are also expected to circulate this fall and winter, creating a triple threat of lung infections.\n\nAnnual flu shots are available now, and the CDC recommends them for everyone 6 months  and older in September and October, especially very young children, people with preexisting health conditions, pregnant people and older adults.\n\nThere are also two vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, available for people 60 and older. Both are single-dose vaccines. Schaffner urges everyone in that age group to get their RSV vaccine, adding that the virus “causes as much respiratory illness” as the flu each year.\n\nWhen to get vaccinated\nTiming when to get your updated Covid-19 shot depends on when you received your last one, Schaffner said. Those who got their last Covid-19 vaccine several months or longer ago should get it in the next few weeks: late September through October.\n\nStudents head back to school in Brooklyn on Thursday, September 7. With Covid-19 cases on the rise, should students take extra precautions? But people who recently received the bivalent Covid-19 vaccine or who were recently infected with the virus itself should wait a bit longer, he said.\n\n“They ought to wait about three months in order to get the maximum benefit from the booster,” Schaffner said. “Most vaccines like this, take about 10 days for full protection to develop and of course it develops day by day.”\n\nThat is how much time it takes for the body to start circulating antibodies through the bloodstream, he said. If you have a trip or a large event coming up, Schaffner said, “give it at least a week, even two weeks is better.”\n\nFor RSV, the CDC is encouraging doctors to administer the new immunizations as soon as possible. Flu shots should be administered during the month of October, Schaffner said, preferably by Halloween, an approach called “flu before boo.”\n\nIt seems like everyone has Covid-19. Here’s why this wave is probably worse than official data suggests\nIt is completely safe for people to get their flu shot and Covid-19 shots on the same day, usually one in each arm, according to Schaffner. He adds that the new RSV vaccines can also be given at the same time as other vaccines, per the CDC’s recommendation.\n\nHowever, Schaffner notes, “people certainly are not obliged to get vaccines simultaneously. If they would like to spread them out, that’s perfectly understandable.”\n\nSchaffner does warn though, “a vaccine delayed is unfortunately often a vaccine never received. So, you’ll have to motivate yourself to seek out the vaccine. You’ll have to go to your doctor’s office or pharmacy two or three times to make sure that you do get all the vaccines for which you are eligible.”\n\nWhere to get vaccinated\nThe new Covid-19 vaccine will be available at some retail pharmacies by the end of the week.\n\n“We expect CVS Pharmacy locations to begin receiving supply of the new COVID-19 vaccines later this week,” CVS said in a statement to CNN. “Our pharmacies will continue to receive them on a rolling basis.”\n\nCovid apathy and fatigue are real. Here’s how to cope\nRight now, patients can schedule a Covid-19 vaccine appointment on the CVS and Walgreens websites.\n\nWalgreens’ Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kevin Ban said in a statement this week, “Eligible individuals will be able to schedule appointments within 24 hours following CDC recommendation.”\n\nAvailable appointments will begin this week, Ban said, and will be on a “rolling basis as stores receive vaccines.”\n\nRite Aid will also have the new vaccine in stores soon. “Our online scheduler with appointments available for customers wanting to receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine will be live on Friday, Sept. 15,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe vaccine will also be available at doctors’ offices and federally qualified health centers.\n\nAppointments for flu and RSV vaccines for older adults are currently available at CVS and Walgreens as well as other retailers, and at doctor’s offices and local health clinics.\n\nCost of vaccinations\nMost people with health insurance will be able to get their updated Covid-19 shot at their doctor’s office or pharmacy, such as CVS or Walgreens, at no cost. Under the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans are covering the full cost of the updated Covid-19 vaccines without co-pays.\n\nPeople who are uninsured — about 28 million Americans, according to KFF — or underinsured may still have access to the updated Covid-19 vaccine for free.\n\nThey will be eligible for free Covid-19 vaccines through the government’s Bridge Access Program, which will distribute shots to local health departments and federally qualified health centers with the help of state and local immunization programs.\n\nThe CDC has also modified existing contracts with CVS, Walgreens, and eTrueNorth — a group that helps independent pharmacies expand their clinical services — to offer vaccination services. More than 20,000 retail pharmacy locations across the country will provide free vaccines to people without insurance, or whose insurance requires a co-pay for in-network coverage, the US Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nBridge Access providers will be added this week to the Vaccines.gov website, which can help people find locations to get the free vaccines.\n\nChildren from low-income families will be able to get free vaccines through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program.\n\n\n\nFlu shots will remain available at no cost through most insurance plans including Obamacare. Medicare Part B also covers flu shots for adults 65 and older.\n\nThe new RSV vaccines for seniors may require a prescription from a doctor and might not be covered by insurance. If not, the shots cost around $300. Schaffner said anyone worried about coverage should reach out to their insurance company for guidance.\n\nCNN’s Brenda Goodman, Deidre McPhillips and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.\n\n\n(This was copied and pasted from CNN.com)",

The evidence pieced together in the aftermath pointed to a well-coordinated plot carried out by the extremist group Al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden.\n\nAl-Qaeda: A Network of Extremism\nAl-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist organization founded by Osama bin Laden in the late 1980s, had gained notoriety for its involvement in various acts of terrorism across the globe. The group operated under a radical interpretation of Islam, driven by a vision to establish an Islamic state based on their extremist beliefs.\n\nOsama bin Laden: The Mastermind\nOsama bin Laden, born in Saudi Arabia in 1957, emerged as the figurehead and spiritual leader of Al-Qaeda. Throughout the 1990s, he orchestrated and financed numerous attacks against American and Western interests. His resentment towards the United States was fueled by grievances concerning American military presence in the Arabian Peninsula and what he perceived as a corrupting influence on Islamic culture.\n\nThe Plot: A Coordinated Act of Terror\nThe September 11 attacks were meticulously planned, involving 19 terrorists, most of whom were affiliated with Al-Qaeda. These terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes, targeting significant landmarks in the United States. Two planes were flown into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane crashed into the Pentagon in Virginia, and the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, intended for another high-profile target, was heroically thwarted by passengers and crashed into a field in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Aftermath: A Nation United in Grief and Resolve\nAs the nation grapples with the devastation and loss caused by this act of terror, a united front emerges, embodying the resilience, courage, and determination of the American people. The nation, under the leadership of its government, vows to bring the perpetrators and those who supported this act of terror to justice. This atrocity has strengthened the resolve of the nation to stand united, heal, and rebuild, ensuring that such acts of hatred will never undermine the principles of freedom and democracy.\n\nThe tragic events of September 11, 2001, forever altered the course of history, prompting the world to confront the harsh reality of global terrorism. The perpetrators, driven by extremist ideologies, sought to spread fear and division, but they ultimately united a nation and the international community in the pursuit of justice and a safer world.",

    "article": "A Nation Forging Its Path: America in the 1810s\nOctober 10, 1818\n\nThe 1810s stand as a remarkable decade in American history, where a fledgling nation, having secured its independence from British rule in the previous century, sought to solidify its identity and assert its place on the global stage. This period was marked by significant developments in politics, territorial expansion, economic policies, and cultural growth, laying the groundwork for the America of the 19th century.\n\nThe War of 1812: A Nation Tested\nThe early 1810s were overshadowed by the War of 1812, a conflict that tested the young republic's determination and unity. Rooted in grievances such as British impressment of American sailors and trade interference, the war was a defining moment for the nation. Despite initial challenges and the burning of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the war ultimately ended in 1815 with the Treaty of Ghent, bolstering a sense of national pride and confirming the legitimacy of the United States on the world stage.\n\nWestward Expansion: The Louisiana Purchase\nThe effects of the Louisiana Purchase reverberated profoundly throughout the 1810s. In 1803, the United States acquired a vast territory from France, nearly doubling its size. This monumental acquisition not only opened up extensive uncharted territories for exploration but also set in motion a westward migration and settlement movement, shaping the nation's geographical and demographic landscape. The vision of a continental nation, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, began to crystallize, steering the course of American expansionism.\n\nIndustrialization and Economic Growth: The American System\nThe 1810s were witness to a burgeoning focus on industrialization and economic development. Championed by statesman Henry Clay, the American System proposed a set of ambitious policies to foster economic growth. It included protective tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing, a national bank to stabilize the financial system, and investment in internal improvements such as roads and canals to facilitate trade and transportation. While not fully realized during this decade, the American System provided a framework that would influence American economic policy in the decades to come.\n\nCultural Renaissance: American Literature and Arts\nAmidst these shifts, the 1810s marked a period of cultural renaissance in America. American literature gained prominence with the works of Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and others, who contributed to the development of a distinctive American literary tradition. Themes rooted in the American experience and landscape emerged, reflecting the burgeoning national identity. Simultaneously, American artists found inspiration in their surroundings, portraying the nation's landscapes and people. This cultural awakening laid the foundation for a rich artistic legacy that would flourish in the ensuing decades.\n\nSlavery and Abolition: A Nation Divided\nThe 1810s witnessed a growing divide in American society over the issue of slavery. While some Northern states actively pursued abolition, viewing slavery as inconsistent with the nation's democratic ideals, the institution of slavery deepened its roots in the Southern states. This dichotomy set the stage for the intense debates and conflicts over the institution of slavery, which would come to a head in the mid-19th century, ultimately leading to the Civil War.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1810s were a pivotal and transformative decade for the young United States. Characterized by war, territorial expansion, economic policy development, a burgeoning cultural identity, and the looming issue of slavery, this period set the nation on a trajectory that would define its growth and evolution throughout the 19th century. The challenges faced and the decisions made in this era shaped the nation's character and laid the foundation for the America we know today.",

As the world stood on the cusp of a new era, the United States found itself grappling with internal and external challenges, setting the stage for the turbulence and progress that would define the 20th century.\n\nThe Progressive Era: A Call for Reform\nAt the outset of the 1910s, the Progressive Era was in full swing. This was a period of intense social and political activism, aiming to address the excesses of the Gilded Age and promote reform. Progressive leaders advocated for workers' rights, women's suffrage, and various social and political reforms. Figures like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson spearheaded these efforts, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's progress.\n\nSuffrage and the Fight for Women's Rights\nOne of the most significant movements of the 1910s was the fight for women's suffrage. After decades of tireless struggle, women's voices were beginning to be heard, and the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1920, granting women the right to vote. This milestone transformed the political landscape and set the stage for future advancements in women's rights.\n\nThe Great War and America's Emergence\nThe 1910s were also marred by the horrors of World War I, a conflict that reshaped the global order. While initially adopting a policy of neutrality, the United States was inevitably drawn into the war, contributing significantly to the Allied victory and emerging as a formidable world power. The aftermath of the war set the stage for the nation's increased involvement in international affairs.\n\nTechnological Advancements: The Age of Innovation\nThe 1910s marked a period of extraordinary technological progress. The proliferation of the automobile revolutionized transportation, and the aviation industry witnessed significant milestones, epitomized by the first non-stop transatlantic flight. These advancements paved the way for the modern age, shaping the way people lived, traveled, and communicated.\n\nThe Red Summer and Racial Tensions\nHowever, the 1910s were also marred by racial tensions and violence, particularly during the Red Summer of 1919. A series of race riots swept the nation, reflecting deep-rooted racial prejudices and the urgent need for civil rights reforms. This period underscored the long road ahead for achieving racial equality in the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1910s were a decade of profound change and evolution for the United States. The Progressive Era set the nation on a trajectory of reform, while women fought for their right to vote. World War I placed the United States on the global stage, and technological advancements laid the foundation for the modern era. Yet, racial tensions highlighted the pressing need for social change. These tumultuous years set the stage for the transformative decades that followed, shaping the America we know today.",
