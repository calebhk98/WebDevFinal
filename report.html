            <h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to
                implement?</h3>
            <p>
                My story is about a historian writing articles looking at the past. This website is open for anyone to create new
                articles, and to comment on any article. So, it is kind of an open source news website, based in the future.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Inspiration: State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites,
                artists,
                blogs).</h3>
            <p>
                I initially thought of this by thinking about my projects I create in my downtime. But some things that I’ve been
                aware
                of for some years that may have inspired me to do those project are similar. One is the website <a
                    href="https://www.futuretimeline.net">www.futuretimeline.net</a>,
                which while it has a different design, has a similar ideology. Another thing was seeing how most companies are
                shifting
                to a more mature look, such as McDonalds removing the red and yellow buildings and replacing them with gray. That
                inspired me to make my website look more mature by adding fewer colors or animations. The last thing is probably a
                youtuber/futurist speaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g">Issac Arthur</a>. He
                often does talks with the National Space Society and has been an instructor
                for USAFA’s Space Policy. Watching his videos has caused me to constantly think about the future in recent terms, so
                is
                likely an inspiration I’ve used.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
            <p>
                My website is accessible by defaulting to gray based coloring. This means the color blind do not have to shift any
                effort to changing the site to match their needs. My site is also designed to allow language translations with
                relative
                ease, as it already has English, Spanish, Japanese, Italian, German, and French translations available to anyone who
                logs in. The site is also set up to allow screen readers to be able to read the site with relative ease. This allows
                the
                blind to also use the site.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Learning: State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</h3>
            <p>
                I had to learn that a website can not write files on the client side, nor even browse through the files dynamically.
                I
                then had to learn how to utilize the localStorage, sessionStorage, and indexedDB in order to allow my website to act
                as
                if it had a server side. I also had to learn how to use mustache in order to allow dynamic recreation of the webpage
                based on factors such as language and the number of articles or comments. I also learned how to use Bootstrap to
                help
                make the formatting appear more mature. I also had to learn how to utilize JS’s asynchronous behavior. Side features
                that I had to find was waiting for an element to be available, turning a string to a hash for the passwords, and how
                to
                download an object as a JSON file.
                I learned these by researching the individual problems, using sites such as geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, github,
                asking
                peers in Stack overflow, or for some weird behaviors such as when creating a new indexedDB it runs the onUpgrade and
                successful actions, I would use GPT to answer my questions, although it seemed to be much worse than other forms of
                research.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?</h3>
            <p>
                I think the dynamic features of being able to register, login, create a new article, leave a comment, and then log
                out
                or even delete your account was particularly successful. Ensuring all the different parts worked together was quite
                impressive, and felt particularly amazing to get working. I also enjoyed how the timeline ended up looking, and how
                the
                dynamic click function works so cleanly, without focusing on any button or link.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to add more features, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>clicking articles in your own account,</li>
                <li>a button on each article to allow one to listen to the article,</li>
                <li>an eye on the passwords to allow one to see their password,</li>
                <li>allow uploading images to each article,</li>
                <li>somehow to allow a forgot username and password,</li>
                <li>add to the user a Blind and Deaf mode that would allow the website to work for each,</li>
                <li>a Dark, Gray, and Light mode,</li>
                <li>a font change per user,</li>
                <li>a map that would allow you to see article only from certain regions,</li>
                <li>and allow a user to move any components around as they wished</li>
            </ul>
            
            If I were to do it differently, I would have started from the get go using indexedDB, having to refactor a lot of my
            code to use it took a lot more time, that I could have use to implement these other functions. I would also probably add
            more people to review the site to get more opinions on the looks, as my idea of what looks nice is not equivalent to
            what the normal person considers nice.
            </p>

            <h3>Resources: What resources did you use in your work? List any sources of information, libraries, plugins, code or tools
            (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using comments)</h3>
            <p>
                I utilized Mustache, Handlebars, Bootstrap frameworks. I also utilized indexedDB, localeStorage, and sessionStorage
                heavily as tools. I used the string to hash function from
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-hash-from-string-in-javascript/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-hash-from-string-in-javascript/</a> with no modifications. I used a function to
                wait for an element to exist from this website
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525071/how-to-wait-until-an-element-exists">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525071/how-to-wait-until-an-element-exists</a> heavily, with no modifications. The last
                major thing I used was a function which allowed one to download an object as a JSON string, with some modifications as
                recommended in the comments from
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19721439/download-json-object-as-a-file-from-browser">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19721439/download-json-object-as-a-file-from-browser</a>.<br><br>
